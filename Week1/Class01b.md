# An introduction to NodeJS and Express

## 1-Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.
middleware is something falls between the functions and methods , 
usually it makes some operations on the requests and response , then it call the next functions on the order.

## 2-Express the most popular __ __ ____.
Express is the most popular Node web framework,
***
## 3-Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?

Opinionated frameworks are those with opinions about the "right way" to handle any particular task. They often support rapid development in a particular domain (solving problems of a particular type) because the right way to do anything is usually well-understood and well-documented
The oppoisite is the "unopinionated" , They make it easier for developers to use the most suitable tools to complete a particular task
and when we say Express in unopinionated , it means you can insert almost any compatible middleware you like into the request handling chain,
in almost any order you like. 
You can structure the app in one file or multiple files, and using any directory structure. You may sometimes feel that you have too many choices.

## 4-What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?
A module is a JavaScript library/file that you can import into other code using Node's require() function.
module can break down a software system into smaller, modular units, developers can reuse these modules in different projects or parts of the same project
also modules can promotes collaboration among developers by dividing the development tasks into smaller
