# Data Structures and Algorithms
## 1- Why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying in this module?

Data structures and algorithms are fundamental building blocks in various fields, 
enabling efficient data processing, problem-solving, and decision-making. Understanding and applying these concepts enhance performance, scalability, and efficiency in writing code

## 2- What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
You can choose the most appropriate data structure that optimizes the efficiency of operations required by your problem.

## 3- How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
To avoid an infinite recursive call stack, you have to ensure that your recursive function has a well-defined base case that terminates the recursion

# Things I want to know more about
Know more about DSA , understand it well !!!!!!! 
use it in projects , and again , understand how and when i have to use it.
