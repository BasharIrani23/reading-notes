# Securing Passwords
When it comes to safely hashing and storing a password, here's how I would explain the process to a non-technical friend
- Hashing: We convert the password into a unique and irreversible string.
- Salt: We add a random string to the password before hashing to make it harder to crack.
- Secure Algorithm: We use a strong and slow algorithm to hash the password securely.
- Storage: We store the hashed password in a database.
By using these techniques, we make it difficult for attackers to retrieve the original password even if they gain access to the stored data.
