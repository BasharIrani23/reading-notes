# Event Driven Programming

### 1- What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?
Node.js natively provides us with a useful module called EventEmitter
### 2- What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?
OOP provides significant benefits in organizing code into reusable objects, thereby facilitating easier management and maintenance. It enables encapsulation of data and behavior, resulting in cleaner and more modular code. When combined with Event Driven Programming, OOP allows us to create event handlers as methods within objects, enhancing code structure and readability.
### 3- Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.
In the context of a social media platform, when a user creates a new post, event-driven programming allows the backend to instantly respond to this event. This enables various actions to be performed, such as storing the post in the database, updating the user's profile, and notifying the user's followers about the new post. By leveraging event-driven programming with Node.js in the platform's backend, efficient handling of user interactions, real-time event processing, data updates, and triggering of relevant actions can be achieved.
