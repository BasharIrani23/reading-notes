# Socket.io Chat Example

### 1-Explain to a non-technical recruiter what the Chat Example (above) does.
It's a AI model designed to simulate a conversation with users. It can understand and generate text based on the input it receives.
### 2-What proof of life are we getting on the backend from the above app?
The backend of the above app provides proof of life by generating responses to user inputs in real-time.
### 3-Socket.IO gives us the i0.emit() method to send an event to everyone. What flag would you use if you want to send a message to everyone except for a certain emitting socket?
*socket.broadcast.emit()*
*** 
# Rooms
### 1-What is a room and how might a room be useful?
A room is an arbitrary channel that sockets can join and leave. It can be used to broadcast events to a subset of clients 
it's useful for scenarios where you want to send targeted messages or notifications to a specific subset of clients, such as users in a particular chat room or participants in a specific event.
### 2-How do you join a room?
You can call join to subscribe the socket to a given channel using *socket.join()* 
### 3- how do you leave a room?
o leave a channel you call leave in the same fashion as join usin *socket.leave()*

### 1-What is a Namespace and what does it allow you to do?
A namespace is a feature that allows you to create separate communication channels or namespaces on top of a single Socket.IO connection 
or it's a a communication channel that allows you to split the logic of your application over a single shared connection (also called "multiplexing").
### 2-Each namespace potentially has its own what? (hint: 3 things)
-Sockets
-Rooms
-Connections
### 3-Discuss a possible use case for separate namespaces
By using separate namespaces for each organization, you can maintain data separation, customize communication logic, and provide a tailored real-time collaboration experience for each organization within your multi-tenant application.
