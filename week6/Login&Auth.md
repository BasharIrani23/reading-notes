# What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?
### 1- What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within an organization. In RBAC, permissions are associated with roles, and users are assigned appropriate roles. This ensures that only users with the necessary permissions can access particular resources or perform specific tasks.

### 2- Share some an example of RBAC including all possible CRUD operations and correlating roles.
Example of RBAC with CRUD Operations:

Imagine a library management system. Different users interact with the system, each having specific roles. Here are the roles and their permissions:

Librarian:

Create: Can add new books to the system.
Read: Can view the list and details of all books.
Update: Can edit the details of books or mark them as borrowed/returned.
Delete: Can remove books from the system if they're damaged or lost.

Member:

Create: Can register for new borrowing requests.
Read: Can view the list of books and their availability. Can also view their borrowing history.
Update: Can renew borrowed books.
Delete: Typically, members don't have deletion rights in this context.

Guest:

Create: No creation rights.
Read: Can view the list of books but not their detailed status.
Update: No update rights.
Delete: No deletion rights.
The above roles clearly define who can perform what operations on the system, making it easier to manage, secure, and audit.


### 3-What are the Benefits of RBAC?

Benefits of RBAC:

Enhanced Security: RBAC ensures that only authorized users can access specific resources, limiting the potential for malicious or inadvertent data breaches.

Efficient Access Management: RBAC reduces the complexity of managing individual user permissions. When a user's role within an organization changes, administrators simply change the user's role in the system, automatically updating their permissions.

Regulatory Compliance: By controlling who can access what, organizations can ensure they comply with data protection regulations, which often mandate strict controls over who can access certain types of data.

Operational Efficiency: When permissions are tied to roles rather than individual users, it streamlines administrative processes. Users can be onboarded or moved between roles more quickly and efficiently.

Reduced Administrative Work: RBAC can decrease the overhead of managing individual user permissions, reducing the potential for errors and ensuring consistent application of security policies.

Auditing and Monitoring: With RBAC, auditing and monitoring become more straightforward. Organizations can quickly review and monitor the actions of users based on their roles, ensuring accountability and compliance with internal policies and external regulations.

Flexibility and Scalability: As an organization grows, RBAC scales by simply adding new roles or adjusting existing roles, making it adaptable to changing business needs.

# react-cookie library
# react-cookies component

### 1-Describe some react-cookie features.
react-cookie features:
react-cookie is a library that facilitates cookie handling in React applications. Some of its key features include:

Hook and HOC support: It offers both hooks (e.g., useCookies()) and higher-order components (HOCs) to provide a flexible way to access and manage cookies depending on your app structure or preference.

Server-side rendering support: This library is compatible with server-side rendering (SSR), which means you can use it seamlessly with frameworks like Next.js.

Cookie Provider: The <CookiesProvider /> component allows you to wrap your application or a part of it to enable cookie management.

Flexible API: You can easily get, set, or remove cookies with provided utility functions and hooks.

Cookie options: When setting a cookie, you can specify various options like path, expires, domain, secure, and sameSite.

Universal cookie: This library also supports universal cookies, which are useful for SSR scenarios where you want consistent cookie behavior between the client and the server.

### 2-Describe some react-cookies features.
react-cookies features:
react-cookies is another popular library for managing cookies in React applications. Its features include:

Simple API: Provides utility functions like load(), save(), and remove() for easy cookie operations.

SSR support: It also supports server-side rendering, ensuring consistent behavior across client and server.

Cookie options: Similar to react-cookie, you can define various options like path, domain, expires, and secure when saving a cookie.

Minimalistic: The library focuses on simplicity and offers a more minimalistic approach compared to some other libraries.

Universal cookie support: Just like react-cookie, this library also offers universal cookie support for consistent behavior in SSR scenarios.


### 3-Which library would you prefer? Why?:

The choice between react-cookie and react-cookies largely depends on your specific requirements and personal preferences.
